## Helloüëãüèº
#### I'm Bilal, A seasoned developer. I have few projects and I'm currently undergoing a SE course.

I'll be writing a few articles on some Js concepts which would be helpful to beginners

**Article1: The difference between let and const in Javascript**

In Javascript, `let` and `const` are both used to declare variables, but they have some key differences in terms of how they can be assigned and their mutability.

1. `let`:
* Variables declared with `let` are mutable, which means their values can be changed after they are assigned.
* `let` allows you to reassign a new value to the variable later in your code.
* Variables declared with `let` have block scope, which means they are only accessible within the block they are defined.
* You can declare a variable with `let` without necessarily assigning it a value right away.
Example:
```
let age = 25;
age = 26; // Value can be changed
```

2. `const`:
* Variables declared with `const` are also block-scoped like `let`.
* However, `const` variables are immutable, which means their value cannot be canged after they are assigned.
* You must assign a value to a `const` variable when it is declared, and you cannot reassign it later.
Example:
```
const pi = 3.14159;
//pi = 3.14; // This would result in an error
```

3. When to Use Each:
* Use `let` when you need to reassign the variable's value or its value will change overtime.
* Use `const` when you want to declare a variable that won't change its value and to enforce immutability for variables that should remain constant.

Choosing between `let` and `const` depends on the use case and whether you expect the value of the variable to change. It's a good peactice to use `const` whenever possible, as it makes your code more predictable and helps prevent unintentional changes to variables that should remain constant. use `let` when you know the variable's value will change or when you need the flexibility to reassign it.
